                Currently: San Francisco <br>
                Future: pending <br>
                Move count: 9 <br><br><br><br>

                I've gone through a lot of moves in my life, all of which have shaped me into who I am,
                and each has led me to a variety of experiences, both personally and professionally! <br><Br>

                I went to college in Boston and graduated with a Bachelors concentrating in finance and marketing.
                My professional experiences range from working in the food industry to working for a top consulting firm. <br><br>

                I always had a knack for creating things, whether it be CO2 dragsters or logos for companies during internships 
                (because that gave me more excitement than crunching numbers in the financial statements). 
                My most current role as an analytics consultant in the tech industry finally gave me the courage to dive into the deep end 
                what I truly want to do, to *CREATE*! <br><br>

                Current position: student at UC Berkeley Extensions - Full-stack Developer program, 
                where I've been putting in a lot of hours and cups of coffee...
