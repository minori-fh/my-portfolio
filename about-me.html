                    I've gone through a lot of moves in my life, all of which have shaped me into who I am
                    and has led me to a variety of experiences, both personally and professionally. <br><br>
    
                    I went to college in Boston and graduated with a Bachelors concentrating in finance and marketing.
                    My professional experiences range from working in the food industry to working for a top consulting firm. My most current role as an analytics consultant in the tech industry finally gave me the courage to dive into the deep end 
                    what I truly want to do, to *CREATE*! <br><br>

                    Current position: student at UC Berkeley Extensions - Full-stack Developer program, 
                    where I've been putting in a lot of hours coding and drinking cups of coffee...
